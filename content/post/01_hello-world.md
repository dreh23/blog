## Dear Joe,

I found someone ... ugh ... I decided to blog. So this is my Hello World of blogging. Read on to listen about my ramblings on why I need to do this (cliffhanger ! :).

<!--more-->

<p>I am a software engineer focused on infrastructure by trade. I am solving IT problems at a Berlin based Visual Effects Company. As the policy to contribute  to open source in my company is somewhat unclear, I can't give back much code to the community. I do file issues and engage in discussions but I want to compensate my lack of contribution with this blog. Maybe some posts are useful for you - maybe not. I am happy for comments.</p>

Hope this will be fruitful for you and for me.

Joe
